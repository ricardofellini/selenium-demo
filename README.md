# Selenium Demo

Hello,
This is a simple project of a login test using Selenium and JUnit.
The project is simple and I did it that way using good practices such as using Page Objects that are indicated by the organization of Selenium, I tried to use the maximum amount of clean code so that this good practice can be used in future projects.
